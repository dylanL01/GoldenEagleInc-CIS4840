# GoldenEagleInc-CIS4840 Background
CIS 4840 Project, Fall 2021 at California State University, Los Angeles

# Description
This project involves developing a Word document that proposes a network design for the 3rd floor of Salazar Hall at CSULA. The document contains network diagrams and topologies that display what devices are on the 3rd floor as well as how they are connected to each other (e.g. wireless access points, switches, computers, etc.). The purpose of this project is to show that all participants of this project understand the concepts of modern telecommunications and technology.

# Additional Information
